    description: "A DIY power bank made from e-waste is a homemade electrical device that provides portable power for charging electronic devices such as smartphones and tablets. It is assembled using discarded electronic components salvaged from old or broken electronics. These components typically include lithium-ion batteries, charging circuits, and USB ports.
